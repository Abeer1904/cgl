          <p class="p">
            Farzi is a card game, quiz show format, and app-based game developed as a fun and interactive way to deepen conversations around debunking fake news and challenging misinformation.
            It pushes media literacy away from a lonely “go find the real news” burden, and towards a more community-based fact-checking experience where people learn together, argue, verify, and build shared judgement.
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            We regularly mine WhatsApp groups, social media platforms, and local information ecosystems to collect forwards and misinformation patterns, and convert them into playable prompts that help people recognise tactics, not just individual claims.
            Over time, the game has been adapted to different contexts and information environments.
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            Farzi has been played across six countries, localised for Nepal, Maldives, Sri Lanka, and Germany, and has also been used to help debunk misinformation during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
            It is referenced in UNESCO’s IPDC manual on strengthening media and information literacy among community media practitioners.
          </p>
          <p class="p">
            Farzi was developed and sustained with support from the Friedrich Naumann Foundation. It remains one of our most widely used and field-tested games.

            <li><strong>Format:</strong> Card game with quiz-show facilitation; also available as an app-based version.</li>
            <li><strong>Players:</strong> Group play (party / classroom / community setting).</li>
            <li><strong>Core mechanic:</strong> Players evaluate claims as true/false, discuss evidence, and learn misinformation patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Party rule (optional):</strong> If a player answers incorrectly, they drink (legal drinking age required).</li>
            <li><strong>Special cards:</strong> Three “skip” cards can be held and used anytime; after use, shuffle back into the deck.</li>

            <li><strong>System:</strong> Local misinformation ecosystems and how trust circulates in communities.</li>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong> trust, identity cues, virality, verification effort, social pressure, platform dynamics.</li>
            <li><strong>Incentives:</strong> why people forward, what they gain socially, and what “being right” means in a group.</li>
            <li><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> speed vs accuracy, belonging vs correction, confidence vs evidence.</li>
            <li><strong>Behavioural insight:</strong> people learn misinformation tactics faster through shared argument than through passive instruction.</li>

          <h2 class="h2">Research &amp; Development</h2>
          <p class="p">
            Farzi is grounded in ongoing observation of real forwards and misinformation motifs circulating in everyday digital spaces.
            The deck evolves through collection, categorisation, testing, and iteration, so that the game teaches recognition of patterns rather than memorisation of answers.

          <p class="p">
            Civic Games Lab has travelled with Farzi for multiple years. While it started as a digital game, it quickly proved highly effective as an offline format, especially in group settings where people reason aloud and negotiate evidence socially.
            It has been played nationally and internationally, including as a quiz-show format.
